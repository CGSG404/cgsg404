        CasinoGuruSG (CGSG) was founded with a single mission: to empower players with transparent,
        accurate, and up-to-date information about online casinos. We review platforms, test their fairness,
        and track player feedback so you can play with confidence.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Our editorial team is composed of passionate gamblers, data analysts, and security experts who
        evaluate each casino across dozens of criteriaâ€”from licensing and RNG certification to payout speed
        and responsible gaming tools.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        CGSG operates independently. We may receive affiliate commissions, but this never influences our
        ratings. Integrity and player safety are always our top priorities.
